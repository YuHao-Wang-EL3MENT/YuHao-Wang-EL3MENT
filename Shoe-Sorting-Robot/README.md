This is a group project that has design a robot which is able to detect shoes, pair shoes, plan its path to the shoe rack and 
plan its manipulator trajectory in the task space. Although I was only responsible for detecting and pairing task, it was my very first AI related project and
I manage to successfully train my own YOLO in detecting different shoe type as well as the gripping point from scratch. I know it wasn't a difficult task but for a 
completely "newbie" who has spent month setting up the envrionment, annotation by hand, configure all the training files all by myself and even purchase a Colab Pro
for a faster training time, I still feel quite accomplished :)

For the paring task, I use the Scale Invariant Feature Transform or the SIFT algorithm. As shown below, the result is quite good.
